## Levels of implementation

### Standard Level:
Adaptive layout of all page elements using the SASS preprocessor.

### Intermediate Level:
Adaptive layout using the SASS preprocessor, implementation of interactive elements on hover, implementation of burger menu logic for mobile devices using JavaScript.

### Advanced Level:
Adaptive layout, implementation of interactive elements on hover, implementation of burger menu logic for mobile devices without using JavaScript (using CSS).

## Requirements:
1. The layout must exactly match the design and be fully adaptive. The design includes three viewports, so you should focus on them.
2. The use of any frameworks or libraries for creating adaptive design is prohibited.
3. Use flex/grid for creating layouts.
4. It is recommended to use Multiple Backgrounds for background implementation.
5. Images must be optimized and, if possible, use SVG.
